Each πdentity NFT ID encodes the address of an individually crafted smart contract, hand-written in EVM bytecode to approximate the value of π by a distinct method. The NFT artwork is a mathematical representation of the associated formula, while the NFT description is the approximation of π, generated directly by the contract.

The implementations of the individual contracts can be found in the `.go` files of this repo.
